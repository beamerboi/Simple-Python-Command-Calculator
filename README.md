# Simple-Python-Command-Calculator
I have done that for a school homework, i hope it helps someone.

The calculator can simply make any simple mathematic equation without issues. 
Type quit to exit the calculator otherwise it will still be using the previous result for a continuos calculation like a real caculator.
